This is my first Git Repository

changes are made final by  commit its like take the creenshot and save it to the memory thus saving the history  
-- version  :  to test the version
ls : to see the directories
clear : to clear the directories
pwd : prints the current working directory

/*
Configuring GitBash:

git config --global user.name="_name_"                // seting the username same as of git hub  by globally means always sets the changes in this github account only
git config --global user.email="github_gmail"         // setting the githubgmail
git config --list                                     // list down the content of git config
